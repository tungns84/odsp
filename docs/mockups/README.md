# UI Mockups

This directory contains the visual designs (mockups) for the frontend application.

> **IMPORTANT RULE:**
> When implementing any screen in the frontend, developers **MUST** refer to the corresponding mockup in this directory. The implementation should match the mockup as closely as possible in terms of layout, spacing, and component usage.

## Naming Convention
Mockup files should be named after the screen or feature they represent.

*   `connectors-list.png` (or .jpg, .fig)
